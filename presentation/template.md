# Code demo

Here's some code:

```hs
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
```

Here's a centered image of a ratio of textwidth:

# Installation

I use nix because I couldn't get a consistent installation of all the tools required otherwise. Get nix here: <https://nixos.org/nix/>

See the contents of `default.nix`, and if you need more packages, try finding by running `nix repl nix/nixpkgs-pinned` (note that it's `nix repl`, not `nix-repl`.):

\small
```
> nix repl nix/nixpkgs-pinned

Welcome to Nix version 2.0.4. Type :? for help.

# Build

Run `make`, or `make watch` if you want to watch on file changes. Note that I use `nix-shell --run` for these, since I don't really want to bother having to start up a nix-shell session myself.

```
> make watch

nix-shell --run 'watchexec -e md make slides'
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/justin/Code/easy-markdown-beamer-pandoc'
pandoc -t beamer source.md -o slides.pdf
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/justin/Code/easy-markdown-beamer-pandoc'
```
